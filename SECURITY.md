# Security Policy

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Open an Issue (Preferred):** Create a private issue if supported, or label it “Security.”
2. **Email:** If you prefer a private report, please contact [gdsc.gwu\[at\]gmail\[dot\]com].

We appreciate your help in making this project safer.
