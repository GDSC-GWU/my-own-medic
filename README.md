## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GDSC-GWU/my-own-medic.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd my-own-medic
    ```
3.  Set up the backend (PHP):

    *   Ensure you have PHP installed and configured on your system.
    *   Place the PHP files (e.g., `chat-history.php`, `chat.php` from the `api/` directory) in a directory accessible by your web server (e.g., `/var/www/html/api/` for Apache on Linux).
    *   Configure your web server to correctly serve PHP files.

## 💻 Local Setup Guide

1.  Install XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP:

    *   These packages provide an easy-to-install environment with Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

2.  Clone the repository into the `htdocs` folder (for XAMPP) or the equivalent directory for your chosen package.

3.  Start the Apache and MySQL servers using the XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP control panel.

4.  Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost/my-own-medic/index.html` in your web browser.  Make sure the PHP files are placed in a directory accessible by your web server. You might need to configure the base URL in your JavaScript files to point to the correct location of your PHP scripts (e.g., `http://localhost/my-own-medic/api/`).

## Steps to Replicate the Setup Locally
1. Use a local web server (XAMPP)
2. Navigate to the project folder.
